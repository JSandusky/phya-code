Phya helps you build realistic interactive sound into virtual worlds.

The library enables the interactive simulation of sound from surface interactions and body resonance, and can be used with physics engines to capture complex collision sounds. A variety of sound models are provided, which can be readily extended. The sound properties of objects are described at initialisation.  During simulation time audio is automatically generated according to collisions between physical bodies.

The source code is made available under the zlib license.
